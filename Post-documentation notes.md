1. “ERROR: Adding a table of contents in Furo-based documentation is unnecessary, and does not work well with existing styling. Add a ‘this-will-duplicate-information-and-it-is-still-useful-here’ class, if you want an escape hatch.”
2. You must verify that the methods, functions, and classes mentioned are actually present in the code, and that the parameters and formulas are correct. If not, correct the discrepancies.
3. I expect classes and methods to be clickable and link to the specific API reference for that class or method.
4. For each class and method in the API reference, automodules with members, undoc members, show-inheritance, and show-module-summary must be included in order to provide complete and detailed documentation.
5. For each class and method, the complete docstrings must be included, with any links, LaTeX formulas, and parameters. If the docstrings contain links, verify that they are correct and lead to the right section of the documentation. If the docstrings contain LaTeX formulas, verify that they are correct and well formatted. If the docstrings contain parameters, verify that they are correct and that they are described clearly and completely.
6. We do not need a separate “Taxonomies” section, but taxonomies must be included in the sections dedicated to metrics and models, in order to provide a clear and complete context for each metric and model. Taxonomies must be well organized.
7. Add the WarpRec architecture image from `imgs/warprec-architecture.pdf` to the architeture section and provide a detailed explanation of the architecture, including the 5 decoupled engines and the Application Layer, as well as the 4 Pillars of WarpRec. Make sure to explain how each component interacts with the others and how they contribute to the overall functionality of WarpRec.
8. Add the WarpRec architeture image from `imgs/warprec-architecture.pdf` to the README.md file and provide a brief explanation of the architecture, highlighting the key components and their interactions. Make sure to emphasize the unique selling points of WarpRec and how the architecture supports these USPs.
