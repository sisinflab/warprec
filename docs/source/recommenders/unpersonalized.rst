Unpersonalized Recommenders
###########################

The **Unpersonalized Recommenders** module of WarpRec serves as a collection of simple baselines.
These models do not learn from individual user interactions but instead rely on global statistics or random selection.
They are essential for producing reference metric scores against which the performance of actual (personalized) models can be compared.

In the following sections, you will find the list of available unpersonalized models within WarpRec.

- Pop:
  Recommends the most popular items overall. This model helps assess whether other recommenders are biased towards popularity.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      models:
          Pop: {}

- Random:
  Recommends items at random. This model defines a lower bound for performance metrics, serving as a sanity check during evaluation.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      models:
          Random: {}

- ProxyRecommender:
  A recommender that uses precomputed recommendations from an external source. This model is useful for evaluating the performance of recommendations generated by other frameworks or algorithms.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      models:
          ProxyRecommender:
              recommendation_file: path/to/recommendations.txt
              sep: "\t"
              header: True

.. important::

  The ProxyRecommender must be executed locally, as it reads recommendations from a specified file.
  This means that in distributed training scenarios, like Ray, the model will raise an error if used.
