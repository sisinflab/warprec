    """The HitRate@k metric counts the number of users for which
        the model retrieved at least one item.

    The metric formula is defined as:
        HitRate@k = number_of_hits / n_users

    where:
        - number_of_hits is the number of users for which the model retrieved at least one item,

    Matrix computation of the metric:

    +---+---+---+---+       +---+---+---+---+
    | 8 | 2 | 7 | 2 |       | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
    | 5 | 4 | 3 | 9 |       | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
    +---+---+---+---+       +---+---+---+---+

    We extract the top-k predictions and get their column index. Let's assume k=2:
      TOP-K
    +---+---+
    | 0 | 2 |
    | 3 | 0 |
    +---+---+

    then we extract the relevance (original score) for that user in that column:
       REL
    +---+---+
    | 0 | 1 |
    | 1 | 0 |
    +---+---+

    HitRate@2 = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.0
